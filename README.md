#To Do List

Here is a simple To Do List app I created during The App Brewery's "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp".

##Usage

The app uses MongoDB to store the items and they can be added or deleted by clicking on the item.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

##Acknowledgment

Once again, thanks to Angela Yu at The App Brewery for designing the app.
